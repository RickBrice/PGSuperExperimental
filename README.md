Experimental features for PGSuper/PGSplice

This project is my sandbox for developing experimental features for [BridgeLink](github.com/wsdot/bridgelink) [PGSuper and PGSplice](github.com/wsdot/pgsuper). 
Right now I'm experimenting with adding BIM for Bridges support by developing IFC import and export capabilities for version 6.2 (or maybe it will be version 7.0).
